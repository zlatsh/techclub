A better way to work together
GitHub brings teams together to work through problems, move ideas forward, and learn from each other along the way.

Write better code
On GitHub, lightweight code review tools are built into every pull request. Your team can create review processes that improve the quality of your code and fit neatly into your workflow.

Start with a pull request
Pull requests are fundamental to how teams review and improve code on GitHub. Evolve projects, propose new features, and discuss implementation details before changing your source code.

Make a change
Start a new feature or propose a change to existing code with a pull request—a base for your team to coordinate details and refine your changes.
